Peer reviewers: Ricardo Santillan-Ramirez and Samaria Tamayo-
  I received some helpful suggestions from Ricardo and Samaria on ways to improve my website. Based on peer feedback, I implemented the following suggestions:
 
   "I’m sure you are working on this, however when clicking through different countries, it appears that the images you included at the bottom of the webpage are broken. The only country page it seemed to show up for is “Iceland”."- Ricardo
   "The homepage is great. Even though I like the way the navigation bar is set up, adding the main title header above the nav bar could help make it stand out better."- Ricardo
   "Increase Text Size for Photo Captions"- Samaria
   "Resize or Reformat Larger Photos for Mobile"- Samaria

 In response, I reviewed the image links and corrected the file paths so they properly display throughout the website. There are some images I still need to add, but the ones currently hanging should be functioning apropriately. The second suggestion, place the main header above the nav bar, was also enacted. I made the changes and agreed that it did improve the layout, making it stand out more. Moving to the next suggestion from Samaria, I reviewed the text size for the photo captions and made the changes, resulting in a definite improvement in readability. For the last suggestion, improve mobile responsiveness, I created media queries to help with the responsiveness on smaller devices, which should resolve the issue.

 Another suggestion, from Samaria, is one I definitely plan to implement in the future. She recommended making the cities in the pin-drop section clickable, linking them to photos related to each trip. I think it's a great idea, but it would require a lot of time to go through them and match the appropriate photos to each city. I plan to continue working on the site after the class ends and will incorporate the recommendation then.
