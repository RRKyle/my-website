          <p>Spending Christmas in Italy was like walking through a living postcard, each city wrapped in its own kind
            of wonder. We began in Pisa, where the Leaning Tower stood proudly in the Piazza dei Miracoli, and the
            surrounding architecture felt timeless under soft winter skies. From there, we made our way to Rome just in
            time for the holiday magic to truly begin. On Christmas Day, we stood among thousands in St. Peter's Square
            in Vatican City, which shimmered with reverence and quiet anticipation, to receive the Papal Blessing—a
            truly unforgettable moment.</p>
          <p>
            Over the course of the week, we explored ancient ruins, wandered the halls of history, and tasted the warmth
            of Italian hospitality. From tossing a coin into the Trevi Fountain to standing beneath the colossal arches
            of the Colosseum, Rome offered one marvel after another. A day trip to Pompeii brought haunting beauty as we
            walked the stone streets of a city frozen in time. Later, the scenic drive along the Sorrentine coastline
            revealed breathtaking views over the Bay of Naples. We ended the journey in Florence, where Renaissance
            masterpieces, quiet piazzas, and the resting places of Michelangelo and Galileo gave the trip a fitting
            sense of reflection. It was a holiday unlike any other—full of history, spirituality, and a kind of beauty
            that lingers long after the decorations come down.

          <p>The year before, in 2017, we experienced a quieter kind of magic in Venice. Visiting in the off-season
            meant we saw the floating city at its most tranquil, wrapped in winter's hush. Upon arrival, we were
            instantly
            captivated by the network of canals and bridges that replaced cars and crosswalks. Gondolas glided silently
            past palazzi worn beautifully with age. We wandered through St. Mark's Square, admired the golden mosaics of
            the Basilica, and watched the sky blush pink over the Grand Canal at dusk. With fewer crowds and a
            reflective stillness in the air, Venice in winter felt like a dream—one painted in water, stone, and light.

          <p>Our Italian adventures began in 2016 with a short but meaningful trip to Milan. The city's cool elegance
            and modern pace were balanced by a deep sense of cultural reverence. The highlight was our visit to Leonardo
            da Vinci's The Last Supper. Hidden within the convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie, the mural revealed itself
            in a quiet room where centuries of history seemed to pause around us. We also took time to admire the Gothic
            beauty of the Duomo and strolled beneath the soaring glass ceilings of the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II.
            Though it was our first of several trips to Italy, Milan set the tone—art, history, and timeless beauty, all
            in one.</p>
