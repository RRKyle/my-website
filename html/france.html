                    <p>Our travels through France gave us a rich mix of history, celebration, and old-world charm. On
                        the way to the Normandy region, we made a meaningful stop in Giverny, where Claude Monet lived
                        and found inspiration for his iconic water lily paintings. Strolling through his serene gardens,
                        past the famous lily pond and Japanese bridge, felt like stepping into one of his
                        canvases—peaceful and timeless. From there, the tone shifted as we reached the historic
                        coastlines of Normandy, ready to explore the powerful landscapes of World War II—an experience
                        we'll never forget. We toured the D-Day landing beaches, stood atop the rugged cliffs of Pointe
                        du Hoc, and visited the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial overlooking Omaha Beach—each
                        stop a solemn tribute to the courage and sacrifice of those who fought there. In the town of
                        Sainte-Mère-Église, we saw a striking and enduring symbol of that history: to this day, a
                        mannequin paratrooper hangs from the church steeple, honoring Private John Steele, who was
                        famously caught there during the airborne landings. That same trip also took us to the stunning
                        Mont Saint-Michel, a tidal island crowned by a medieval abbey. Its winding stone streets and
                        panoramic views made it feel like we had stepped into a medieval masterpiece brought to life.

                    <p>Another unforgettable visit was to Paris for a New Year's Eve celebration. As the clock
                        approached midnight, the Eiffel Tower lit up in a glittering display, and the air along the
                        Seine buzzed with excitement. Fireworks, cheers, music, and the sounds of many intoxicated
                        individuals filled the night, making it a truly cinematic way to ring in the new year. The
                        following morning was quiet and peaceful. We set out to find a local café and enjoy a good cup
                        of coffee, taking time to reflect on the night before as the city slowly came back to life—then
                        continued on to Notre-Dame Cathedral, still fully intact in all its Gothic splendor before the
                        devastating fire of 2019, where its stained-glass windows and towering façade offered a moment
                        of quiet awe in the heart of the city.</p>
                    <div class="line-fade"></div>
                    <p>On a separate trip, we visited Strasbourg during the holiday season to experience its
                        world-famous Christmas market. With its timber-framed buildings, festive lights, and cozy aromas
                        of mulled wine and spiced pastries, the city felt like a winter fairytale. Each market stall
                        seemed to glow with festive charm, and the atmosphere felt straight out of a winter fairytale.
                        From historic reflections to joyful celebrations, France gifted us some of the most poignant and
                        lasting memories of our time in Europe.</p>
